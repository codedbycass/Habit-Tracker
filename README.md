## What

This is a full-stack application designed to help users track their habits. Users can utilize pre-logged habits or customize their experience by entering their own habits in the input box. Upon completing a habit, they can click "Done" to keep track of how many times they've accomplished it.

## How It's Made

The Habit Counter App is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: Used for server-side development.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: Utilized for both client and server-side functionality.
- **APIs**: Integrated to enhance the application's features.
- **MongoDB**: Employed as the database to store habit data.

The core functionality is implemented on the server side using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This involves sending requests to the server to handle habit data. On the client side, event listeners are utilized. Users click buttons to initiate CRUD functions and interact with the application. 

## What I've Learned

Building this Habit Counter App has provided valuable insights. Despite the apparent simplicity of the application, its internal workings can be more complex, especially when creating both the client and server sides. Well-planned and well-written code is crucial for maintaining a straightforward application.

Key Takeaways:

- **Complexity Under the Hood**: Simple apps can have intricate workings behind the scenes.
- **Code Planning**: Planning and organizing code are essential for a smooth development process.
- **Client-Server Communication**: Understanding how the client and server communicate is crucial, especially when dealing with CRUD operations.

When developing CRUD applications, breaking down the work into manageable chunks and ensuring a clear understanding of the communication between the client and server are key to success.
